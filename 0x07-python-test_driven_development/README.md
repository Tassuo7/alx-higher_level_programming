#Background Context
##Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects
* Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything
* The intranet checks for Python projects wont be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you dont miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
* Dont trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases
